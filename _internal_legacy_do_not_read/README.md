# Legacy Snapshot (Do Not Use)

This directory is a historical snapshot of pre-restructure packages.

- It is not part of the active build graph (`go list ./...` does not include it).
- Do not import packages from this tree for new work.
- Use active packages at repository root (`daemon`, `machine`, `infra`, `platform`).

Keep this tree only for reference while migrating old notes and context.
